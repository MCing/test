This is a git practice log.
First we know that git is a distribute version control tool,different from cvs and svn.
I have used svn before, and the main process is as follow:
1.create a repository in your central server(in web or your own computer);
2.new files(plain text,program,but binary file is not prefer);
3.commit your file to the central server.

However, as a distribute tool,git let us build our repository in our computer and also push it to web to share with others.
1.clone or init a repository in your computer;
2.create, modify your files;
3.add your files to your local repository(in a termporary area), which means git can track your added files;
3.commit your added files from the termporary area to the real repository;
4.push your repository to the central server.

Commands :
git init       //create a new repository
git clone     //clone a repository from other place
git add file  
git commit
git push
git status
git log
